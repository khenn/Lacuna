To use this API you will need the following:

Perl 5.10 or higher
Moose
Module::Find
JSON::RPC::Common::Marshal::HTTP
LWP::UserAgent
Config::JSON
Modern::Perl
DateTime
DateTime::Format::SQLite
Try::Tiny
DBI
DBD::mysql


Unzip this archive to any folder you choose.

You will need a mysql database running
Run the lacuna.sql script found in thd docs/ directory
TO DO: Remove mysql dependency in favor of some sort of persistant file storage.

Patches welcome!

Example scripts can be found in <lacuna_root>/sbin

The web service API is now entirely wrapped and matching methods do not need
to be added in order to call the API.  You simple create a session:

$session = Lacuna::Session->new($configFile,$username,$password);

Then you can call methods directly against the web service API which can be found here:

https://us1.lacunaexpanse.com/api

For instance, Lacuna::Empire is a wrapper for the following API:

https://us1.lacunaexpanse.com/api/Empire.html

You can call methods directly from this API by calling the method as listed
and passing the params as an array reference:

$empire  = Lacuna::Empire->new($session);
$result  = $empire->get_status([$session->session_id]);
$result  = $empire->is_name_available(["Empire Name"] );

Any new methods added to Lacuna's Empire API become instantly available
in this fashion without the need to add supporting wrapper methods.


NOTE:  There may still be some individual building methods that are not properly
updated to support calling them directly from the web services API.  I will
spend some time next weekend fixing the methods so they are all available
via Lacuna's normal web service method as documented
